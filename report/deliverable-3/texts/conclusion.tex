\section{Conclusion}
As a group, we are very pleased with the process and outcome of this group project. Our final product consists of substantial contributions from all our team members. It was tested and integrated with the systems produced by ML and HCI groups, completes all of the tasks initially identified and the development relied heavily on our use of scrum. 

For the final deadline we successfully combined all parts of the system into one final server, completing any remaining tasks which included file management, file conversion and testing. Our system was integrated both with our assigned ML and HCI groups, as well as with other groups, thus ensuring the compatibility of our contribution to the whole pathology system.
