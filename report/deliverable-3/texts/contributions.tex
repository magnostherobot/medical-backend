Throughout the development of our back-end server, I was responsible for thorough testing, which involved writing unit tests with mocha and chai, running integration tests through Postman as well as identifying and fixing bugs. During the last sprint I worked closely with Hafeez using pair-programming to resolve a range of issues flagged by the tests. Furthermore, I worked with Tom and Callum finalizing server-side file-management.
