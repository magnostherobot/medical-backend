Throughout the development of our back-end server, I was responsible for thorough testing, which involved writing unit tests with mocha and chai, running integration tests through Postman as well as identifying and fixing bugs. One of the main challenges in this respect was understanding code written by other team-members. Clear and frequent communication between all members proved essential to this process.

During the last sprint I worked closely with Hafeez using pair-programming to resolve a range of issues flagged by the tests. Furthermore, I worked with Tom and Callum, finalizing server-side file-management. I was mostly involved with the file-system part of file storage, integrating the node-module `multer' with our server. `multer' was later swapped out for the package `body-parser' to allow compatibility with our assigned ML and HCI groups.

My role in the development of the server, involved producing the authentication system and providing security to each of the routes in the RESTful API. This was done through node.js libraries including \textit{passportjs} and \textit{jsonwebtokens}. I also tested the functionality of this after implementation to ensure it was working using tools such as Postman and curl. Whilst also conducting tests for authentication, I assisted Johannes in running and resolving test issues found in other parts of the implementation. By using more than one team member on larger tasks, it took less time to solve these problems. This took a considerable amount of time during the last sprint, as testing was required to be much larger and thorough for the fully implemented system. During the later sprints, I was also designated as scrum master. This meant I was responsible for organising tasks and managing time, and removing obstacles the team may face. 

As a team member, I did not feel that there were any major obstacles which impeded the development of the system. However, there were some issues regarding time and managing work set out by other modules within the Computer Science course. Some sprints clashed with other pieces of coursework that also needed to be completed. Therefore, additional care was needed when organising tasks related to the project and planning was required for an extended period of time which would overlap other upcoming coursework deadlines. This way as a team we could plan around other unrelated submissions.
