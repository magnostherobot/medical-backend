Throughout the development of our back-end server, I was responsible for thorough testing, which involved writing unit tests with mocha and chai, running integration tests through Postman as well as identifying and fixing bugs. One of the main challenges in this respect was understanding code written by other team-members. Clear and frequent communication between all members proved essential to this process.

During the last sprint I worked closely with Hafeez using pair-programming to resolve a range of issues flagged by the tests. Furthermore, I worked with Tom and Callum, finalizing server-side file-management. I was mostly involved with the file-system part of file storage, integrating the node-module `multer' with our server. `multer' was later swapped out for the package `body-parser' to allow compatibility with our assigned ML and HCI groups.
