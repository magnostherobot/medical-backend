\section{Aims for Final Submission}
As we already had most of the basic implementation working since our second submission, our main task for the final deadline was resolving numerous issues, extending the test coverage and completing file conversion. Several meetings were organised between groups to check the compatibility between our back-end system and HCI and machine-learning groups.
\begin{description}
  \item[Extend Test Coverage] Verification and validation of our server's functionality became the focus of our last submission.
  \item[File Upload, Download and Conversion] One of the last remaining tasks for this submission was implementing the serving of files through our server.
  \item[Intra-group Collaboration] The key to ensuring the success of our system was testing the compatibility of our server with the work of other groups.
