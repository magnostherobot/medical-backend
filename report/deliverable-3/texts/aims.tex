\section{Aims for Final Submission}
As we already had most of the basic implementation working since our second submission, our main task for the final deadline was resolving numerous issues, extending the test coverage and completing file conversion. Several meetings were organised between groups to check the compatibility between our back-end system and HCI and machine-learning groups.
\begin{description}
  \item[Extend Test Coverage] Verification and validation of our server's functionality became the focus of our last submission.
  \item[Manage Filetype Conversions] A main part of this submission was creating a file converter for all the required file types that would be needed.
  \item[Testing] As our code was getting more complicated we wanted to make sure that extensive testing was implemented to create a more secure and consistent system.
