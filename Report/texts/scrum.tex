\section{Continued use of Scrum}
The scrum process was continued as we found this very useful in terms of clearly setting out tasks for each member and managing the progress of the implementation. In general the size and the time taken of each individual task was a lot smaller when comparing to the last submission. 
\subsection{Scrum board}
Again, the scrum board was used to outline and track the completion of each task. This gave a clear visual representation of the objectives. With everyone now being in the same location it also made it a lot easier for everyone to set up and manage ongoing tasks.
\subsection{Sprints}
As a team, it was decided that we would have only a single sprint, up until the next point of submission. This was because of the short time period, enough for only a two week sprint. In addition to this, the sprint assessment process was completed more often to ensure that as a team time was managed well and sufficient progress was being made. 
\subsection{Meetings}
Regular meetings were also held to discuss and evaluate progress. This was crucial in the scrum process and as working in a team to allow a point of communication between each member at the same point in time. Multiple meetings were held during the most recent sprint to determine the tasks required for completion, to evaluate whether each task was completed and track progress in between. 
The minutes for formal meetings are available in the Appendix.
