\section{Continued use of Scrum}
In general the size and the time taken of each individual task was a lot smaller when comparing them to the last submission. We found using scrum extremely helped in managing this to clearly set out tasks and outline what everyone was doing.
\subsection{Scrum board}
We again went with using a board system to set up and allocate tasks. This gave a clear visual representation of what we wanted to achieve. With everyone now being in the same location it also made it a lot easier for everyone to set up and manage ongoing tasks.
\subsection{Sprints}
Now being familiar with the scrum process we decided to reduce the length of the sprints. This was also based on the fact that tasks were smaller and that the sprint assessment process needed to be undertaken more often to make sure we were on the right track with our progress as a team.
\subsection{Meetings}
As we were attempting to do shorter sprints we held more regular meet ups to discuss progress and make design decisions as a team.
The minutes for formal meetings are available in Appendix~\ref{app:meet}.
