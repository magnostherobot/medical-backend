\section{Conclusion}
As a group we have made a lot of progress for this submission, we were proactive in setting out goals for ourselves and feel we are now well on track to produce an outstanding final hand in. Our continued use of scrum has helped keep workload consistent and effective right through to this submission and we hope to continue in this way. Having now combined our work with the HCI group we are looking forward to working with machine learning to tie together all 3 groups to create the desired system set out by the project owner.
