### Requirements Overview:
For every version you submit, you are required to submit the following to MMS as a team:  

1) A working version of your software, which includes a test suite. By version we
mean a version of the finished product. It is up to you to decide how you have divided
the entire finished product into versions.

2) A report which details how you have followed the SCRUM process.  

    It should include:

    a) A list of all user stories contained in your Product Backlog and Release Backlog;
       this is expected to evolve from version to version.

    b) Documented evidence that you have followed SCRUM, e.g., timestamped photographs of
       your Product Backlog, Release Backlog, Sprint Backlogs, and task boards (if you
       are using a physical whiteboard), or timestamped screen grabs of any tools you
       are using instead.

    c) The process you used to estimate how long user stories would take to implement.
       A burndown chart should also be included to track progress.

    d) Team structure and role assignment

    e) Meeting outcomes: sprint planning, sprint retrospective, and an overview of
       stand-up meetings (i.e. meetings donâ€™t need to be documented individually)

3) You should then demo the working version of your software to your supervisor at
   one of your regular meetings.






### Design Choices:
- Scrum

- Database

- Server






### Year Wide Protocol Compilation:
As part of this practical, a final solution to the over-arching problem is that the end-user
should be able to "*pick-n-mix*" one submission from each [Backend, HCI, Machine Learning].  
In order to successfully achieve this, all of the participating groups throughout the year
are required to formulate between themselves and agree on a single protocol for each
component to talk over.
Various meetings were organised on a variety of topics between members who were interested
in affecting the outcome. Minutes of these meetings can be seen at:

### Scrum:
After groups were eventually allocated for this group project, the team met up quickly to
discuss the **Scrum** method of doing work, and figure out how roles should be shared amongst
the team members.  
It was initially decided that Tom would be the "Scrum Master", and Calum would be the
"Product Owner", and that the roles would be rotated around other group members,
approximately bi-weekly.  
A quick brainstorming session was then had to interpret our specification and quickly fill
in the User Epic stories, along with some more decomposed stories and requirements.

    - Need to upload the pictures of our scrum board to the repository!
